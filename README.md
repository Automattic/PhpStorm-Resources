PhpStorm-Resources
==================

PhpStorm is making inroads at Automattic. Here you'll find various helpful files we've made.


WordPress.xml
-------------

`WordPress.xml` is the PhpStorm code style configuration file that some of us use. It tells PhpStorm to as closely match WordPress's recommended formatting style as possible.

To install it, find your [configuration directory](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/webhelp/project-and-ide-settings.html) and then put it in the `/config/codestyles/` subfolder.

WordPress Support in PhpStorm
---------
PhpStorm has added support for WordPress as of Version 8 which is currently available by JetBrains as part of their [Early Access Program](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PhpStorm/PhpStorm+Early+Access+Program).

There is an [in depth tutorial](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PhpStorm/WordPress+Development+using+PhpStorm) to learn how to use these new features for WordPress development (including plugins, themes and core).
