PhpStorm-Resources
==================

PhpStorm is being very popular at Automattic. This repository used to contain a code formatting configuration file designed for WordPress but this was before PHPStorm added support natively. As it's natively supported now, we have removed our custom version in favor of theirs.

In the future, we may add new files here.
